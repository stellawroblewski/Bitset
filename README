allocBitSet uses two helper functions (getBytesForBits and the constructor)
it uses the constructor to create the bitset and get BytesForBits to determine the nu,ber of bits to initialize if the input is not a multiple of 8

setbit uses two helper functions (getCharIndex and getBitShift) to find the index 
of the bit to be set and sets it

clearbit operates the same way as set bit, but shifts using a different method

getbit as well

readbitset is commented out bc i didn't get it completely working but it first counts the length of the file, creates a bitset of that length, then opens the file again and goes char by char, setting incrementing indices of the bit based on the char

writebitset opens the file and increments through the whole bit and writes each to the file


 test functions for all the main functions can be uncommented in main and each has a variable "num_bits" at the top which can be manipulated to change the size of the bitset
